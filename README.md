# Personal Porfolio

![portfolio-thumbnail](#notes)

The few files and folders used to build [my portfolio page](https://kernixwebdesign.com/resume-portfolio.html).

## Notes

- I have a number of lines of HTML commented out as I am unsure of the Dev icons to include in my portfolio.
- I have a link commented out in my resume-portfolio.js file where I got tips on the accessibility for a hamburger icon and for JavaScipt keyboard events
- I also have tried linking to Google fonts and using a link in the HTML file, so you will see additional code commented out.

That is about it.

# Personal Porfolio

![portfolio-thumbnail](/portfolio-thumbnail.PNG)

<br>

The files and assets used to build [my portfolio page](https://courageous-cuchufli-816711.netlify.app/) which is deployed on Netlify.

<!-- ## Notes

I have changed the _projects_ section more than any other part of the page. I also added `details.html` to go into more detail for each project. I have also changed the details page many times so this portfolio keeps evolving.

index.html:

- I ordered the `<meta>` tags in the `<head>` section which looks better to me

style.css:

- My project cards have changed so many times that my CSS is not as orderly as it should be. And since adding my _clients_ section on the `details` page it's gotten worse.
- I pulled in Google Fonts using `@font-face`, although I could have added those in `<style>` tags in the HTML files. I need to look into which approach is the best for loading external fonts.

script.js:

- I have a link commented out in my `script.js` file where I got tips on the accessibility for a hamburger icon
- Although the accessibility of the mobile menu is great, I do not like the lack of animation or the content shift when the menu is opened and closed -->

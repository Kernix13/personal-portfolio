              <p>YelpRetreat is a variation of a full-stack app that I built. I wanted to change not only the styles but also the complexity by creating different types of retreats.</p>

              <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
              <p>Learning the basic Express server setup became second nature. It was not so intuitive to change the project structure to
              an MVC pattern. Also, working with Mongo Shell and Mongoose was very helpful in introducing me to back-end
              technology.</p>

              <h3>Is the app complete?</h3>
              <p>There are features and style changes that I would like to make. One thing I would like to add is to prevent a retreat owner from being able to add a review to their own listing. It would also be nice to have an average overall rating for each retreat.</p>

              <p>Also. the use of the JS <code>every</code> method was the main "helper" method for getting the functionality I needed.</p>

              <p class="project-intro-p">This app uses The Movie Database API to show cards for the most popular movies and TV
                shows. The cards have links to the details for each show or movie. On the details page, there are also links
                to YouTube videos and to a Cast and Crew page for the show/movie.</p>
              <p>The cast and crew page has cards for the cast members with links to a personal page for each cast member. The
                crew cards are the same but I split the cards up by department.</p>

              <h3>Why this app for my portfolio</h3>
              <p>The design and styles were from a Brad Traversy project. I prefer to design my own projects, but the design
                is nice. I chose to add this project to my portfolio because I added additional API calls and details that
                were not part of the course project.</p>

            <div class="section-div">
              <h3>Challenges encountered</h3>
              <p>It took me some time to figure out how to get the movie/show title onto the cast and crew page. I also had to
                create different cards for members with or without a photo. Finally, sectioning the crew by department
                took a good amount of time and code.</p>

              <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
              <p>Working with an API and using the results from fetching data to make another API call was insightful. I also
                became very comfortable <em>properly</em> manipulating the dom with methods such as
                <code>createElement</code>, <code>createTextNode</code>, and <code>setAttribute</code>.</p>

              <h3>Is the app complete?</h3>
              <p>I would like to use Netlify functions so that I can hide my API key but I am unsure how to use <code>export.handler</code>
                with all the files that rely on my API key, or the results from fetching the data.</p>

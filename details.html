              <p>As for the code, this was originally a Vanilla JS app but I converted it to TypeScript. I plan to add

              <p>Instead of having to type every character, I use RegEx to create arrays for 1) common words by letter, and
              2) common phrases (in content.js). I then map thru those arrays and output the words into a menu for each letter of the
              alphabet letter, and an accordian for the phrases.</p>

              <p>It is essential to have a clear plan of what you want to accomplish. As I built the app, I added feature
                after feature which required changes to the CSS and HTML. Planning out the full-featured app
                would have been better.</p>

              <h4 class="build-desc">Overview</h4>
              <p>The user has to enter the fret numbers for the chord they need to be named. They also have options to choose one of thirteen tunings (Standard default), and to choose a sharp or flat key (sharp default). The tuning chosen populates the DOM with the notes for each string and the notes are used to build string arrays.</p>

              <h4 class="build-desc">Building arrays and objects</h4>
              <p>Based on the tuning and the sharp/flat checkbox, all 6 strings are built with the correct notes. Duplicate user notes are then filtered out, intervals are created with each unique note as a chord root. The intervals are converted
              into an object and that object is used to find a match in <code>chord-intervals.js</code>.</p>

              <h4 class="build-desc">Special cases</h4>
              <p>If at least one matching chord was found with the same number of notes, I perform 7 conditionals for what in music is
              known as <em>enharmonic equivalents</em>. The conditionals are not complex, but without these checks, the output field "Chord
              notes" would sometimes have the wrong notes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section-div">
              <h4 class="build-desc">Finishing touches</h4>
              <p>I have a number of small code blocks to put the Chord Notes in "proper" order, create a slash chord or not, and check to
              see if the notes are equal to 2 or more chord names. Then I get the chord tendency and chord intervals values from
              <code>chord-intervals.js</code> and finally write everything to the DOM.</p>

              <p>This app is complete for its purpose but it can be much better. I would like to have an option for ukeleles, banjos &amp; mandolins. I also intend to load the users&apos; tuning and sharp/flat selections into local storage, and finally create an SVG
              chord shape based on the users&apos; notes.</p>

              <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
              <p>A lot of the description above references music theory, so I apologize for that. But music theory had to be incorporated to make this app do what it does, and to handle all the edge cases to return the correnct chord name.</p>

              <p>Also. the use of the JavaScript <code>every</code> method was the method I needed for the chord name and other

              <h3>Why I built this app?</h3>
              <p>Bushcraft is a hobby of mine and one aspect of it is using and setting up tarps. Each tarp setup/config requires different heights and angles for the setup. So I felt this would make a great personal project. This app would be useful for campers, backpackers, bushcrafters, or anyone who has struggled trying to raise a tarp into
              the air for protection against the elements.</p>

                React application.</p> -->

              <h3>Challenges encountered</h3>
              <p>I had to build my first responsive Hamburger menu and back-to-top button in React, and since I did not use <code>create-react-app</code> I had issues loading my images. I did some research for the image issue and found that without Webpack I needed to import the images into my files. Lastly, I had to design the tarp graphics in Inkscape, as close to 3D as my skills allowed.</p>

              <p class="project-intro-p">The details below are not what I would call <em>projects</em>, but are rather the steps I took to help different website owners.</p>
              <p>I have done unpaid volunteer work for two WordPress site owners. Another client is from Fiverr who was unfamiliar with how WordPress works and built his website using a block theme.</p>
              <p>Another Fiverr client had a simple request involving HTML. Specifically, that client provided me with PDF files with tables that needed to be converted to HTML <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> elements.</p>
              <p>As I get other clients for any type of website needs, I will add a short summary of the details for each job. Here are summaries for the 4 clients mentioned above.</p>

          <!-- Client section 1 -->
          <h3 class="client-heading">#1 Camping Ventures Hub</h3>
          <div class="client-row row-reverse">
            <div class="client-col">
              <a class="client-link link-image" href="https://campingventureshub.com/" target="_blank"><img
                  src="./images/camphub.jpg" alt="" class="client-img"></a>
            </div>
            <div class="client-col">
              <p>The client's website <a href="https://campingventureshub.com/" target="_blank">Camping Ventures Hub</a> was an affiliate marketing blog. The job had 2 milestones, the first for determining why the domain would not load, and the second for building or "fixing" 5 more pages.</p>
              <p>The client chose a Block theme named <em>Yith Wonder</em> but he was unfamiliar with WordPress and so knew nothing about the admin area, Gutenberg blocks, or block themes.</p>
              <p>He also configured the WordPress admin area incorrectly and had his host company create a staging area which was totally unnecessary for a brand new website with no pages.</p>
            </div>
            
          </div>
          <h4>Issues and the Solutions:</h4>
          <div class="client-row">
            <div class="client-col">
              <p>1. <strong>Issue</strong>: The staging area link worked but the domain link was timing out.</li>
              <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I noticed that the client added the staging area link in the Site Address and WordPress Address URL fields which means his domain had no pages. Bluehost fixed the error.</p>
              <p>2. <strong>Issue</strong>: Home page images were 100's of kilobytes. They were sized to 800px wide but displayed at ~ 300px wide.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I brought the images into Photoshop, reduced the size, optimized them for the web, and then
                uploaded the new lightweight images to the media library.</p>
              <p>3. <strong>Issue</strong>: The footer lacked the elements and styling that the client wanted.</p>
              <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I edited one of the footer template files and added the current elements including the newsletter form that I created.</p>
              <p>4. <strong>Issue</strong>: The header lacked a proper menu with links to the category pages.</p>
              <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I created the categories since they did not exist and then added them to the header menu.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="client-col">
              <p>5. <strong>Issue</strong>: There were no blog posts to see the styling for the blog page, categories pages, or single post pages.</li>
              <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I created a single sample post for each category which allowed us to see how the templates displayed on the front-end.</p>
              <p>6. <strong>Issue</strong>: The Home, Archive, and Single templates had limited styling and needed layout changes.</p>
              <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I edited the templates per the client&apos;s requests for the features and styles he wanted.</p>
              <p>7. <strong>Issue</strong>: No favicon.</li>
              <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I brought his logo into Inkscape, removed the wordmark, and used just the graphic as the favicon.</p>
              <p>8. <strong>Issue</strong>: The client&apos;s lack of knowledge of WordPress.</li>
              <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I created a draft post with notes about the template files, Gutenberg blocks, and theme options so that he would be able to continue building the site on his own.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- Client section 2 -->
          <h3 class="client-heading">#2 propMeUp</h3>
          <div class="client-row">
            <div class="client-col">
              <a class="client-link link-image" href="https://propmeup.net/" target="_blank"><img src="./images/propmeup.jpg" alt=""
                  class="client-img"></a>
            </div>
            <div class="client-col">
              <p>The client's website <a href="https://propmeup.net/" target="_blank">propMeUp</a> is a non-profit charity site that was started by a WordPress designer from Fiverr but who abandoned the project.</p>
              <p>The owner was on a timeline to obtain funding for the charity and 3 pages needed to be built and the images on the other pages needed to be replaced.</p>
              <p>The additional issue for the client is that the site was built using the page-builder Elementor and the original designer installed a dozen plugins in support of Elementor.</p>
              <p>This was a volunteer job for a person in my local area who had no knowledge of WordPress let alone Elementor and a host of plugins.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <h4>Issues and the Solutions:</h4>
          <div class="client-row">
            <div class="client-col">
              <p>1. <strong>Issue</strong>: The Events and Contact pages had not been created and therefore lacked content.</li>
              <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I created the pages, copied design elements from the Join page, and then made edits. I also created a contact form with custom CSS.</p>
              <p>2. <strong>Issue</strong>: The Home and About pages had spacing, font size, and many other issues.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I changed the padding, margin, font size, and changed the layout until the client was happy. I then applied those styles to every other section and page throughout the site. The previous designer used pixels for everything &mdash; I replaced <code>px</code> with <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code>.</p>
              <p>3. <strong>Issue</strong>: The sticky header was unreadable due to reduced opacity on scroll.</p>
              <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I deleted the header and built a simpler header that was not sticky. The site had a back-to-top button so a sticky header was not needed.</p>
              <p>4. <strong>Issue</strong>: The testimonials slider had the text obstructed by the ornamental double-quotes <em>&ldquo;</em> on small screens.</p>
              <p><strong>Solution</strong>: Elementor had different slider options so I switched to another design that did not have any issues.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="client-col">
              <p>5. <strong>Issue</strong>: The images on the pages needed to either be changed or minimized. The image sizes were in the Megabyte range.</li>
              <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I downloaded every image and reduced the filesize using Photoshop then uploaded the smaller files and used them on the pages.</p>
              <p>6. <strong>Issue</strong>: There were many plugins that were installed in support of Elementor.</p>
              <p><strong>Solution</strong>: I migrated the site onto my local machine and then systematically disabled every plugin to see if there was any loss of functionality or styling. I removed all the plugins that were not needed.</p>
              <p>7. <strong>Issue</strong>: No favicon.</li>
              <p><strong>Solution</strong>: Luckily the client hired a graphic designer who did a great job and had a version of her logo with just the <em>UP</em> and up arrow (see website). I resized that and used it for the favicon.</p>
              <p>8. <strong>Issue</strong>: The client&apos;s lack of knowledge of WordPress and Elementor.</li>
              <p><strong>Solution</strong>: We did a number of Slack Huddles where I shared my screen and explained how to work with Elementor.</p>

          <!-- Client section 3 -->
          <h3 class="client-heading">#3 Two Average Gamers</h3>
          <div class="client-row row-reverse">
            <div class="client-col">

            </div>
            <div class="client-col">
              <p>This was another volunteer opportunity that I found on a job board named Flexjobs for <a href="https://twoaveragegamers.com/" target="_blank">Two Average Gamers</a>. My job was to improve the page speed and to look at the overall design and page structure. I was not able to do much for the design but I did address the other 2 issues.</p>
              <p>The Google Insights Performance score was in the mid to low 40% range. I was able to get it as high as 73% until it settled at 69-70%. The main drag on the page load speed was Mailchimp (free version) loading the enrtire jQuery librrary.</p>
              <p>The site also had multiple Contact, About, and other duplicate pages. They site owners were unaware of this. I created the code for 301 redirects and I talked them through how to add it to their cPanel <var>.htaccess</var> file.</p>
            </div>
            
          </div>

          <!-- Client section 4 -->

            </div>
            <div class="client-col">
              <p>This was another Fiverr gig for someone from <a href="https://www.liftmaster.com/" target="_blank">Lift Master</a>. I had to convert 7 tables in a PDF file to HTML elements.</p>
              <p>I did create an excellent <a href="https://codepen.io/jim-kernicky/pen/gOjyWeJ" target="_blank">responsive table design</a> but this job only required using a number of <code>rowspan</code> and <code>colspan</code> attributes.</p>
              <p>I copied the text from the PDF files and pasted it into a markdown file. Then I created the <code>table</code> element with <code>thead</code> and <code>tbody</code> tags, and with no content in the <code>td</code>, <code>tr</code>, and <code>th</code> tags. Then it was just a cut/paste process making sure that <em>my</em> table text matched exactly what was in the PDF files.</p>
